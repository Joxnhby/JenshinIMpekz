Even if the giant serpent is long dead, you can still clearly feel the traces of its power left behind. Under the influence of the Tatarigami, Yashiori Island has been deserted by its inhabitants. What can be seen on the island are just endless rain and thunderstorms trying to wash away the remnants of the past.",
